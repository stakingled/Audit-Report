Why is the audit result “Secured” and not “Well-Secured”?

The EtherAuthority team states that to reach the level of "well-secured", the contract must not have any human influence, meaning fully decentralized with no owner control.

Contract owners should decide for themselves whether or not to retain ownership of contracts based on their own business rules and the nature of the smart contracts. In some cases it is not advisable at all to renounce ownership of the contracts.
